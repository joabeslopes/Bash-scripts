# Bash-scripts

Some scripts i use that may be useful for someone else.

They include backup scripts using the cli program **duplicity**, so if you don't know it yet, that's the moment.

For backups to S3 storage, you need to install the **boto3** module, using pip. That is done with command:

> `pip install boto3`
